# TODO

This todo list is for minor items that need to be addressed.  Use github issues for anything major.


- [ ] Add goreportcard.com badge to the README files
- [ ] Align CLI flag patterns across apps or document differences prominently
- [ ] Evaluate dev-cache output-mode enhancements (summary toggle vs docs)
- [ ] Centralize config schema/version guidance and validation for all apps
